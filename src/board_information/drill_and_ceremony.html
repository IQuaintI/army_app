      <header class="question">What is the history of "Retreat"</header>
      <p class="answer">
        The term "retreat" is taken from the French word "retraite" and refers
        to the evening ceremony. The bugle call sounded at retreat was first
        used in the French army and it dates back to the Crusades. Retreat was
        sounded at sunset to notify sentries to start challenging until sunrise
        and to tell the ranks to go to their quarters. The old cavalry call "To
        the Standard" was in use since 1835 and has been replaced by the current
        call "To the Color". This remains as music honoring the flag as it is
        lowered in the evening

      <header class="question">What is the history of "Reveille"?</header>
      <p class="answer">
        Reveille was not originally intended as honors to the flag. In 1812, it
        was a drum call to signify that Soldiers should rise for day duty and
        sentries should leave off night challenging. As time passed, reveille
        came to denote when the flag was raised in the morning and honors were
        paid to it
