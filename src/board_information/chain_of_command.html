      <header class="question">
        Can commanders delegate authority and responsibilty to a subordinate? If
        so, explain?
      </header>
      <p class="answer">
        Commanders are responsible for everything their command does or fails to
        do. However, commanders subdivide responsibilty and authority and assign
        portions of both to various subordinate commanders and staff members. In
        this way, proper degree of responsibilty becomes inherent in each
        command echelon. Commanders delegate sufficient authority to Soldiers in
        the chain of command to accomplish their assigned duties, and commanders
        may hold these Soldiers responsible for their actions. Commanders who
        assign responsibilty and authority to their subordinates still retain
        overall responsibilty for the actions of their command

        How is seniority determined among enlisted members when they are of the

        First by date of rank. When rank of service is the same then by total

        federal service are the same then seniority will be determined by date
        of birth
