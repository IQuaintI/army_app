      <header class="question">
        If a Soldier uses the open-door policy, can they recieve an Article 15
        fo failing to use the chain of command?
      </header>
      <p class="answer">
        No. While using the chain of command is specifically preferred, AR
        600-20 directs commanders at all levels to have an open-door policy and
        a Soldier cannot be prevented from seeing a commander or other senior
        enlisted leader to communicate a problem or issue. In these situations,
        the first line leaders should attempt to determine why the Soldier did
        not feel comfortable discussing the issue with the first line leader

      </header>
      <p class="answer">
        Commanders will ensure they establish an open-door policy. The timing,
        conduct, and specific procedures of this policy are determined by the
        commander
