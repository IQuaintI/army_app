      <header class="question">
        When conducting a line of duty investigation on a Soldier who has caused
        intentional harm to themselves, is this considered a line of duty
        situation?
      </header>
      <p class="answer">
        No, if a Soldier causes injury to themselves intentionally it cannot be
        a line of duty "YES". The AR states that if a person who becomes a
        casualty as a result to their own intentional misconduct or wilful
        negligence, it is NEVER considered a line of duty situation.
