        Describe the M320/M320A1 grenade launcher.
      </header>
      <p class="answer">
        It is a lightweight grenade launcher that can operate in a standalone or
        attached configuration. It uses a double-action trigger system. It can
        accurately engage targets as far away as 350 meters. It has ambidextrous
        operating controls and a sling mount point allowing the weapon to be
        fitted to the soldier. The swing out barrel aids the soldier in rapid
        reloading.
