        I will discharge carefully and diligently the duties of the grade to
        which I have been promoted and uphold the traditions and standards of

        As a non-commissioned officer, I accept the charge to observe and follow

        laws, articles, and rules governing the discipline of the Army<br />

      <header class="question">The NCO Creed</header>
      <p class="answer">
        No one is more professional than I.<br />
        I am a noncommissioned officer, a leader of Soldiers.<br />
        As a noncommissioned officer, I realize that I am a member of a time
        honored corps, which is known as "The Backbone of the Army".<br />
        I am proud of the Corps of noncommissioned officers and will at all
        times conduct myself so as to bring credit upon the Corps, the military
        service and my country regardless of the situation in which I find
        myself.<br />
        I will not use my grade or position to attain pleasure, profit, or
        personal safety.<br />
        Competence is my watchword.<br />
        My two basic responsibilities will always be uppermost in my
        mind—accomplishment of my mission and the welfare of my Soldiers.<br />
        I will strive to remain technically and tactically proficient.<br />
        I am aware of my role as a noncommissioned officer.<br />
        I will fulfill my responsibilities inherent in that role.<br />
        All Soldiers are entitled to outstanding leadership; I will provide that
        leadership.<br />
        I know my Soldiers and I will always place their needs above my own.<br />
        I will communicate consistently with my Soldiers and never leave them
        uninformed.<br />
        I will be fair and impartial when recommending both rewards and
        punishment.<br />
        Officers of my unit will have maximum time to accomplish their duties;
        they will not have to accomplish mine.<br />
        I will earn their respect and confidence as well as that of my
        Soldiers.<br />
        I will be loyal to those with whom I serve; seniors, peers, and
        subordinates alike.<br />
        I will exercise initiative by taking appropriate action in the absence
        of orders.<br />
        I will not compromise my integrity, nor my moral courage.<br />
        I will not forget, nor will I allow my comrades to forget that we are
        professionals, noncommissioned officers, leaders!

      <header class="question">Army Value: Loyalty</header>
      <p class="answer">
        Bear true faith and allegiance to the U.S. Constitution, the Army, your
        unit and other Soldiers.<br />
        Bearing true faith and allegiance is a matter of believing in and
        devoting yourself to something or someone.<br />
        A loyal Soldier is one who supports the leadership and stands up for
        fellow Soldiers.<br />
        By wearing the uniform of the U.S. Army you are expressing your loyalty.
        And by doing your share, you show your loyalty to your unit.

    <section class="content">
      <header class="question">Army Value: Duty</header>
      <p class="answer">
        Fulfill your obligations. Doing your duty means more than carrying out
        your assigned tasks.<br />
        Duty means being able to accomplish tasks as part of a team. The work of
        the U.S. Army is a complex combination of missions, tasks and
        responsibilities — all in constant motion.<br />
        Our work entails building one assignment onto another.<br />
        You fulfill your obligations as a part of your unit every time you
        resist the temptation to take “shortcuts” that might undermine the
        integrity of the final product.

    <section class="content">
      <header class="question">Army Value: Respect</header>
      <p class="answer">
        Treat people as they should be treated.<br />
        In the Soldier's Code, we pledge to “treat others with dignity and
        respect while expecting others to do the same.”<br />
        Respect is what allows us to appreciate the best in other people.<br />
        Respect is trusting that all people have done their jobs and fulfilled
        their duty.<br />
        And self-respect is a vital ingredient with the Army value of respect,
        which results from knowing you have put forth your best effort.<br />
        The Army is one team and each of us has something to contribute.

    <section class="content">
      <header class="question">Army Value: Selfless Service</header>
      <p class="answer">
        Put the welfare of the nation, the Army and your subordinates before
        your own.<br />
        Selfless service is larger than just one person.<br />
        In serving your country, you are doing your duty loyally without thought
        of recognition or gain.<br />
        The basic building block of selfless service is the commitment of each
        team member to go a little further, endure a little longer, and look a
        little closer to see how he or she can add to the effort.

    <section class="content">
      <header class="question">Army Value: Honor</header>
      <p class="answer">
        Live up to Army values.<br />
        The nation's highest military award is The Medal of Honor.<br />
        This award goes to Soldiers who make honor a matter of daily living —
        Soldiers who develop the habit of being honorable, and solidify that
        habit with every value choice they make.<br />
        Honor is a matter of carrying out, acting, and living the values of
        respect, duty, loyalty, selfless service, integrity and personal courage
        in everything you do.

    <section class="content">
      <header class="question">Army Value: Integrity</header>
      <p class="answer">
        Do what's right, legally and morally.<br />
        Integrity is a quality you develop by adhering to moral principles.<br />
        It requires that you do and say nothing that deceives others.<br />
        As your integrity grows, so does the trust others place in you.<br />
        The more choices you make based on integrity, the more this highly
        prized value will affect your relationships with family and friends,
        and, finally, the fundamental acceptance of yourself.
      </p>

    <section class="content">
      <header class="question">Army Value: Personal Courage</header>
      <p class="answer">
        Face fear, danger or adversity (physical or moral).<br />
        Personal courage has long been associated with our Army.<br />
        With physical courage, it is a matter of enduring physical duress and at
        times risking personal safety.<br />
        Facing moral fear or adversity may be a long, slow process of continuing
        forward on the right path, especially if taking those actions is not
        popular with others.<br />
        You can build your personal courage by daily standing up for and acting
        upon the things that you know are honorable.

        Men in rags, men who froze,<br />
        Still that Army met its foes,<br />
        And the Army went rolling along.<br />
        Faith in God, then we're right,<br />
        And we'll fight with all our might,<br />
        As the Army keeps rolling along.<br />
        <br />
        Refrain:<br />
        Then it's hi! hi! hey!<br />
        The Army's on its way.<br />
