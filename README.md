## Introduction

This is a project devoted to creating a website that will display multiple sources of information regarding the Army.

The Army already has their own website and massive databases of information, but this project is meant to be a more user-friendly and accessible version of that information.

Furthermore, this is a project to test the skills of the developer and to create a portfolio piece.

Wish us luck!

## Requirements

- Create a homepage that will have a list of the information that we want to house and links to each category.
- Create pages that will display the information regarding the category that was selected.

## Potentials

- Create a flashcard page that will display flashcards that will help with studying for the Army's promotion boards.
- Create an interactive map that will allow for the user to click on a point and have information about that point displayed. This is designed to assist with land navigation.

## Design

- The webpage background color has yet to be determined, but the native white is too bright so that will at least be dialed back (potentially gray or dark blue).
-Create intuitive navigation that will allow for the user to easily find the information they are looking for.

## Implementation

- This whole affair should use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Libraries might be imported to help with the design and functionality of the website.
